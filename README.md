# Continuos-Bayesian-Networks
## Wrote a scientific article about Bayesian Networks using continuos variables to calculate the probability of a person having chronic kidney disease (CKD).

# Python
Used Python to clean a marker database for a sample of patients with and without CKD.

# R
Used R script to elaborate a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) which represents the dependence relationships of variables to determine whether a patient is prone to chronic kidney disease and to be able to detect it in time
